I am a dedicated robotics researcher. My research interests focus on SLAM, MAV, and 3D reconstruction. I have been working on **continuous mapping with uncertainty based on the Gaussian process** for over **five years**. Don't miss our novel LiDAR system [SLAMesh](https://github.com/lab-sun/SLAMesh), which differs from the LOAM-based method.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at **HK PolyU** under the supervision of [Prof. Zhang Dan](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/zhang-dan-prof/). Before that, I received both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at Zhejiang University (**ZJU**).
